//   // // NOT SUPPORTED Called at the beginning of each stage (after onRoundStart/onStageStart)
//   // onStageStart(bot, game, round, stage, players) {},

//   // Called during each stage at tick interval (~1s at the moment)
//   onStageTick(bot, game, round, stage, players, secondsRemaining) {}

//   // // NOT SUPPORTED A player has changed a value
//   // // This might happen a lot!
//   // onStagePlayerChange(bot, game, round, stage, players, player) {}

//   // // NOT SUPPORTED Called at the end of the stage (after it finished, before onStageEnd/onRoundEnd is called)
//   // onStageEnd(bot, game, round, stage, players) {}
// };)
